# Record Linkage problem

Record linkage is the process of identifying pairs of records that refer to the same
thing. In most cases, each record refers to a person, and the challenge is to identify 
which records refer to the same real person. This challenge arises in many different areas,
including companies trying to avoid sending mail to the same person multiple times; 
hospitals trying to track data on the same patient across several visits; and many other
situations.

Generally speaking record linkage problem is a problem of identifying same entities in a dataset (often set of different datasets)

## Entity linking

Entity linking is a subset of broader Record Linkage problem, where entites are linked based on their names. E.g. John Kennedy needs to be considered same entity as J. F. K or Джон Кеннеди
